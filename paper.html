        <h3> Swipe, and Let Go</h3>
        <p id="paragraph"> by Salomé Noufele</p>
        <p id="essay">Living right between Hell’s Kitchen and the Upper West Side my whole life has caused a hole in my identity. Each New Yorker has their own pocket of the city that they call home; exerting pride about your community is the norm here, and I didn’t meet it. I used to tell people I live on the Upper West Side, but never felt a real connection to the neighborhood. One day in my seventh grade English class, I mentioned where I lived to my teacher, to which he responded: “That’s not the Upper West Side.” I was distraught by his comment; whom did he think he was to tell me he knew my neighborhood better than me? Looking back on that moment, I realize I was only upset because there was truth to what he was saying. Since then, my response to where I live has been, “behind Columbus Circle,” which is vague enough to ensure that my ego won’t get shattered, again. Belonging to a neighborhood has always been something that I’ve longed for, but never felt like I truly had. While being stuck in the middle of two distinct places has always felt uncomfortable, there was always one spot in my vicinity that came natural to me: the subway station.</p>
        <p id="essay">The 59th Street-Columbus Circle station is the closest station to my house. I associate myself with Columbus Circle and the subway — I’ve created my own neighborhood that only I belong to. This station has been a pillar of my many commutes around the city; it has looked over me as I always swiped my metrocard, even when others were hopping the turnstiles and I could have done the same. This station has seen me hesitate between taking the local train or waiting for the express. I’ve bought breakfast and snacks at the Turnstyle Market, shopped for gifts and strategically acquired candy from the Dylan’s Candy Bar shop without paying. The subway station is a constant that gives me a sense of confidence and allows me to be in control: at 59th street, I feel like anything is possible. </p>
        <p id="essay">In the train station, strangers perform small acts of kindness, like holding the train car door open for you or letting you take the seat they clearly wanted, tempting you to believe that fate has brought you together. Although, most commuters are ordinary people. They might be smiling at someone across the tracks while waiting for their train, listening to rhythmic music flow through their ears. For a couple minutes, their brain might wander into an imaginary world — where there are no transit systems, no places to get to, no problems to solve —  until the wind from the subway coming into the station blows in their face, and they snap out of it. To most locals, the 59th Street station is just another place where they can take the subway. They restrict themselves to only one experience, one so bland that they can only reach euphoria through their imagination. </p>
        <p id="essay">Yet they are missing out on so much adventure  that is right in front of them. Even since its construction in 2016, the Turnstyle Market at the 59th Street has completely changed the subway experience. Stores, restaurants and Starbucks have made for a unique assimilation of transportation and fun. Whether one is in need of a phone case, fresh donuts, or a handcrafted card, there is something for everyone. My personal favorite store is a small bakery that sells two muffins for the price of one after six PM on weekdays. The memories that I have made in this mini-mall are priceless: luxury isn’t needed to fulfill happiness, an emotion that seems deceptively out of reach for some.</p>
        <p id="essay">New Yorkers get caught up in a fast-paced lifestyle and put our happiness on the backburner. But if we paused for a moment, we would realize there is so much to appreciate in just our surroundings, there is no need to look far. The 59th Street station represents a hub where people come from different parts of the city and are united through taking the subway. For only $2.75, one can explore all of New York, and the possibilities are endless. No need to limit yourself to your usual route, risks are welcome in this space. You might accidentally board a train going in the wrong direction and then end up discovering places they would have never gone to before. Don’t be intimidated by the grandness of the building, don’t stress out about running late; this subway station adapts for every rider that passes through. It is seemingly the most plain places like subway stations that carry so much value to our communities, and to ourselves. </p>
