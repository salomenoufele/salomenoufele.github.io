        <p id="essay"> The process of developing this feature article was very different from any other writing assignment I’ve had in the past. I forced myself to embrace new techniques instead of shying away from them. I was not used to developing claims before starting to write, but they eventually helped guide my writing. Highlighting and copy/pasting phrases from my freewrites is another thing I hadn’t done before, yet I was able to gain some valuable insight from those exercises regarding what components I needed to have in my final draft. Writing is a very personal and creative process, and I tried to lean into that while developing my article. Being passionate about your topic is important, especially for a project like this that is based on personal experience. Once I picked a topic that I felt was representative of my New York, my writing flowed with ease. After typing everything out, I had to make major cuts and keep only the essential information that helped make this piece a true feature article.  I’m proud of what I have created, and am happy to say that I’ve written my very first feature article. </p>
